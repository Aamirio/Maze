Maze

A program which allows one to explore through a Maze (in a text file)

Run the application through the Explorer class entrypoint. It is command line user interaction. You can run it in Intellij like you would with any other Java application. Be sure to supply one of the file names from the resources folder, either "Maze1.txt", or "Maze2.txt". Program arguments for Java applications can be set in Intellij by clicking on Run -> EditConfigurations -> and then in the Explorer class' configuration you will see a Program Arguments section, just type in the file name there.

Once it is running you will see a message in the terminal window to tell you to "Begin Exploring" Simply click on the last line of the terminal window and enter either F to go Forward, L to turn left, or R to turn right, you can also enter C to find out the cursor's current coordinates.

You can also run it in a command window using the java command.
